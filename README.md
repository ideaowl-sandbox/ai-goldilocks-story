# Slides/code for Puzzle Entropy as a Measure of Puzzle Difficulty
## Introduced as "AI Goldilocks and the Three Billion Puzzles"

For setup, do a ```npm install```.

After that, ```npm start``` should start the site/slides.

Configuration for the most part is under ```src/assets/data/config.js``` and ```src/assets/data/pieces.js```.  Most of the custom code for Latex and puzzle setup is under ```src/assets/js/ScrollApp/puzzleSetup.mjs``` 

## Important AIIDE note

The AIIDE slides are under the [aiide-2023](https://github.com/ideaowl-sandbox/ai-goldilocks-story/tree/aiide-2023) branch, which is a subset, with some modifications, of the original thesis presentation.
